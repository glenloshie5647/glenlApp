The provided code is a React component that uses the `react-redux` library to connect to the Redux store. The component is named `DefaultStory`, and it imports a function called `configureStore` from the `redux-persist` package.

The `configureStore` function is used to create a Redux store with persistence enabled using the browser's local storage. This means that any changes made to the state of the application will be saved in local storage and restored when the user revisits the page.

The component then connects to this store using the `connect` higher-order component from React-Redux, which takes two arguments: a selector function (`mapStateToProps`) and an action dispatcher (`mapDispatchToProps`). The selector function maps parts of state (in this case, just 'store') into props for DefaultStory, while mapDispatchToProps passes down dispatch methods as props.

The decorator `{provider: true}` sets up React Context API with provider for sharing state across tree components without having prop drilling issue. It provides access of Redux Store to all child components within its scope by wrapping them with Provider element in render method or as Higher Order Component(HOC). 

It looks like there are missing pieces such as mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps functions which are required for connecting this component with redux store and handling actions accordingly.
